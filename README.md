# Sorting-Algorithms

  The project consists in the implementation of the following sorting algorithms in Python on different sets, intervals of numbers and types of data:
   - [x] Bubble sort
   - [x] Insertion Sort
   - [x] Count Sort
   - [x] Radix Sort base 10
   - [x] Radix Sort base 16
   - [x] Merge Sort
   - [x] Quick Sort Median of three
 
  Types of data tested:
   - [x] int
   - [x] float
    
   Intervals:
   - [x] 100 elements between 0 and 100, 0 and 1000, 0 and 10000, 0 and 100000, 0 and 1000000
   - [x] 1000 elements between 0 and 1000, 0 and 10000, 0 and 100000, 0 and 1000000
   - [x] 10000 elements between 0 and 10000, 0 and 100000, 0 and 1000000
   - [x] 100000 elements between 0 and 100000, 0 and 1000000
   - [x] 1000000 elements between 0 and 1000000
    
   Particularities of the data sets:
   - [x] random array
   - [x] almost sorted array
   - [x] sorted array in descending order
   - [x] constant array
